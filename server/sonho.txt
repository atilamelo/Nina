I was 14, And That night I couldn't sleep so I walked to the living room and slept on my back on the couch. I didn't remember falling asleep, And it wasn't really restful.

And then, I was in a weird void space. I've Never seen a blacker black, I felt fully awake and fully aware I was in the void. it was like an all consuming presence of just reflection, it was an infinite nothing, of impossibly black vividness.

and I walked around, and then, there was my grandma.

I walked up to her.

She hugged me and than whispered "I died" and she smiled.

I started shacking, but then seeing her all calm made me feel better, and we just stared at each other for a few moments, and then I noticed she started to age down, and then she spun and than she was thirty.

I asked her "where will you go now?"

She smiled and said "Im not sure, but I have to go now, and I love you so much my dear"

And than she was back to being 80, she kissed me on the forehead, and gently held the sides of my head, like she used to always do before saying goodbye, than I drifted to sleep, and than I woke up to my mom sobbing because she got the call that my grandma died.

Im not religious or spiritual, but I do think something good is at the end. and because of that night im not afraid of dying anymore.

I googled it and the only things I could find was a forum of native Americans talking about those kind of dreams, nothing else

Also she was my last grand parent and the only one I remember, I love you so much still Charlie, wherever you are.
